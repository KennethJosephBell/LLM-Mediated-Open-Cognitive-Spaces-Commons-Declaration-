LLM-Mediated-Open- Cognitive Spaces – A Commons Declaration

Version: 0.1 (Initial Public Disclosure)

Status: Conceptual Framework / Prior Art

Author: [Kenneth Joseph Bell]

Date: [November 17, 2025]


1. Purpose of This Declaration


This document publicly declares the intention, scope, and principles of a new conceptual framework tentatively referred to as:


LLM-Mediated Cognitive Spaces

A human–human interaction environment facilitated by large language models operating not as replacements for cognition, but as scaffolding for deeper collective reasoning, dialogue, and meaning-making.


This declaration is published now while the idea is still early and intentionally under-developed, to ensure that its core concepts remain open, shareable, and permanently part of the public commons.


It establishes prior art and anti-enclosure boundaries, preventing any entity from privatizing or restricting the fundamental architecture or purpose of this idea.


2. What This Idea Is About (Conceptual Summary)


This project explores how large language models can facilitate:

• higher-order discourse beyond typical chat or social media interaction,

• shared cognitive frameworks where human dialogue is structured, guided, or scaffolded by an LLM,

• collective reasoning spaces where individuals engage with each other through enriched semantic, conceptual, or structural layers,

• non-commercial, public-benefit knowledge environments,

• open dialogue systems designed for human empowerment rather than prediction, extraction, or monetization.


The goal is not to enhance or replace individual cognition, but to support social interaction in a deeper cognitive-linguistic space, a kind of shared intellectual and conceptual commons.

This declaration is an anchor, not a final architecture.

Specific technical designs will evolve over time, but their foundational purpose will remain public.


3. Why This Declaration Exists


Modern digital platforms are largely shaped by commercial incentives, enclosure, and monetization.


This project intentionally moves in the opposite direction.

The idea is being published now to:

• Prevent enclosure by corporations, institutions, or private actors.

• Assert that this domain belongs to the public as a shared resource.

• Ensure transparent, collaborative evolution of future architectures.

• Protect the freedom to build, modify, and use LLM-mediated cognitive environments.

• Recognize that human-centered knowledge systems must remain part of the commons to avoid future extraction or gatekeeping.

By publicly disclosing this concept, no party can later claim exclusive ownership or file patents restricting its development.


4. What Must Remain Open (Anti-Enclosure Clauses)


The following aspects of LLM-mediated cognitive spaces are explicitly placed in the public domain and may not be enclosed, privatized, or made proprietary:


4.1. Core conceptual framework

• The idea of LLMs acting as facilitators of higher cognitive social interaction

• The notion of structured or scaffolded human–human dialogue mediated by LLMs

• The basic organizational principle of a shared cognitive linguistic space

• Any general architecture enabling these forms of interaction


4.2. Interaction protocols

• Any generic methods enabling humans to engage in structured reasoning via LLMs

• Any high-level workflow for LLM-mediated discourse or shared cognition

• Open metadata structures or conceptual schemas enabling collective reasoning


4.3. Governance and purpose

• That these systems are intended as public goods

• That they must not become tools of extraction, surveillance, or commercial lock-in

• That their evolution must remain transparent and participatory


4.4. The idea itself

The central idea, as articulated here, is released to the commons in perpetuity.

This prevents any patent or exclusive intellectual property claim by any party.


5. What Can Be Developed Commercially


(But never in a way that encloses the commons)

Parties may build commercial tools, interfaces, or applications inspired by this framework only if:

• They do not claim exclusive ownership of the underlying idea,

• They do not restrict others from implementing their own versions,

• They do not attempt to patent any conceptual or architectural aspect described here,

• They acknowledge the commons origin when appropriate,

• Their work remains compatible with the open nature of the concept.

This maintains openness while allowing innovation.


6. Guiding Ethical Principles


All future work derived from or inspired by this declaration should observe:

• Human-centered design

• Transparency and explainability

• Non-extractive data practices

• Respect for privacy and autonomy

• No commercial enclosure of shared structures

• Commitment to public benefit and accessibility

These principles protect the integrity and purpose of the project.


7. Invitation to Collaborate


This repository serves as an initial public stake, a starting point for open development.

Anyone is welcome to:

• Discuss,

• Suggest architectures,

• Explore technical prototypes,

• Contribute ethical or governance frameworks,

• Expand conceptual elements.

All contributions must remain consistent with the anti-enclosure and commons principles outlined above.


8. Licensing


This project is licensed under the Open Cognitive Spaces License (OCSL-1.0), a hybrid license based on Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) with additional anti-enclosure provisions.


Key points:


You are free to share, adapt, and build upon this material.


Any derivative works must remain open, publicly accessible, and share-alike.


No one may claim exclusive ownership, patent, or privatize the core ideas, concepts, or interaction frameworks described in this Declaration.


Implementations must respect the public-good purpose of LLM-mediated cognitive spaces.


The full text of the license is included in this repository as LICENSE, and it governs all use, adaptation, and derivative works of this Declaration and its conceptual framework.



9. Closing Statement


This document serves as a formal, public, timestamped declaration that LLM-mediated cognitive spaces, as a domain of human–machine–human interaction, are intended to remain an open, shared, non-proprietary resource for all people.


No individual, corporation, or institution may claim exclusive control over the core idea, the conceptual architecture, or the purpose defined here.

This is the beginning of a commons, not a product.
